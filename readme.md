# WOLF - Windows Operations & Library of Functions C\# 

My very first program that morphed into a Frakenstein mess! I am rewriting this program from scratch now that Windows 10 has changed the way administration works.

I feel my program is still necessary but a good clean rewrite would also allow me to utilize my improved knowledge and skills.

This initial release is based on v0.3588. Also take note this is the one flagged for being vicious malware by AV companies. Willing to sell me a yearly certificate of about 120$ to help get my kick ass software off their blacklists...
