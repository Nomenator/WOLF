# WOLF - Windows Operations & Library of Functions C\# 

My very first program that morphed into a Frakenstein mess!

I am rewriting this program from scratch now that Windows 10 has changed the way administration works.

December 21st, 2106

This was the last refactoring / code cleanup before beginning an entire rewrite as UWP.

This program now comes up either 100% clean or one false positive on VirusTotal.

Seems that will be the best I can get with it.
