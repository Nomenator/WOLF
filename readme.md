# WOLF - Windows Operations & Library of Functions C\# 

My very first program that morphed into a Frakenstein mess!

I am rewriting this program from scratch now that Windows 10 has changed the way administration works.

December 23rd, 2016

This was the last refactoring / code cleanup before beginning an entire rewrite as UWP.

Identified the function name tripping anti-virus software "DisableWindowsKeyLogging" and KeyLogging bool variables have simply been renamed.
VirusTotal 100% clean again.

This program now comes up either 100% clean or one false positive on VirusTotal.
